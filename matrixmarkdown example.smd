# Matrices as Markdown Tables

In addition to using commands like `tabulate`, `estimates table`, etc.
to produce native Markdown tables (without code-fenced monospace), it
is easy to write a function that will display ***any*** matrix as
a Markdown table.

First, we will run an estimation command, which produces (at least)
two matrices, `e(b)` and `e(V)`.

```
<<dd_do>>
clear all
sysuse auto
quietly regress mpg price weight i.foreign
<</dd_do>>
```

Now we can display the coefficient and precision matrices
(no code fences).

<<dd_do>>
mata:  matrixmarkdown("e(b)")
mata:  matrixmarkdown("e(V)")
<</dd_do>>

The table's style is modified by a stylesheet (a bit of HTML code).
For tables of numbers, it helps to have something -- extra padding
or cell borders -- to separate the table cells visually.
